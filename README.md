### Abstract (Referenced from the original paper):
Video memorability is a measure of how likely a particular
video is to be remembered by a viewer when that viewer has no emotional
connection with the video content. It is an important characteristic as
videos that are more memorable are more likely to be shared, viewed, and
discussed. This paper presents results of a series of experiments where
we improved the memorability of a video by selectively cropping frames
based on image saliency. We present results of a basic fixed cropping as
well as the results from dynamic cropping where both the size of the crop
and the position of the crop within the frame, move as the video is played
and saliency is tracked. Our results indicate that especially for videos of
low initial memorability, the memorability score can be improved.
